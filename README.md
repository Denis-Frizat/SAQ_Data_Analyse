# SAQ_Data_Analyse

I am currently working at SAQ as a seller and advisor in spirits and wines. This is an amazing world, and I am eager to understand the market dynamics and the impact of ads on product sales.
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using real-world data from the SAQ. The focus is on the four shops where I work, making the data especially meaningful to me.

I extend my gratitude to the SAQ team supervisor for their time and kindness in answering my questions about the data collection software and the data itself.
